# Matrix Operations-Diagonal Matrix Elements Printer 🧮

This Python program reads a matrix of any size from the user and prints **only the diagonal elements**, leaving other elements blank in the output.

## 📌 Aim

To write a Python program that prints only the diagonal elements of a given matrix.

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Read the number of rows and columns from the user.
2. Initialize an empty matrix of size `rows × columns`.
3. Populate the matrix with user input.
4. Display the full matrix.
5. Iterate through the matrix and:
   - If `i == j`, print the element (main diagonal).
   - Else, print a blank space.
6. Print a newline after each row.

## 🖥️Program

```python
rows = int(input())
cols = int(input())

matrix = []

for i in range(rows):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    matrix.append(row)

for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(cols):
        if i == j:
            print(matrix[i][j], end=" ")
        else:
            print(" ", end=" ")
    print()
```

## Output

```text
3
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
1     
  5   
    9
```

## Result

Thus, the Python program was successfully executed to print only the diagonal elements of the given matrix.
